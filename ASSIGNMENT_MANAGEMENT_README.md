# Assignment Management System

This document describes the new assignment management features that have been added to the Grading Project application.

## Overview

The assignment management system provides professors with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing assignments within their classes. Students can view assignments and submit their work, while professors can manage the assignment lifecycle.

## Backend Endpoints

### New Assignment Endpoints

#### 1. GET `/assignments/{assignment_id}`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve a specific assignment by ID
- **Access**: Professors and students enrolled in the class
- **Response**: Assignment details including name, description, and metadata

#### 2. PUT `/assignments/{assignment_id}`
- **Purpose**: Update an existing assignment
- **Access**: Professors only (must be teaching the class)
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Updated Assignment Name",
    "description": "Updated assignment description"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Updated assignment details

#### 3. DELETE `/assignments/{assignment_id}`
- **Purpose**: Delete an assignment
- **Access**: Professors only (must be teaching the class)
- **Validation**: Cannot delete if assignments have existing submissions
- **Response**: Success message or error with details

### Existing Endpoints (Enhanced)

#### 1. POST `/classes/{class_id}/assignments/`
- **Purpose**: Create a new assignment for a class

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Assignment Name",
    "description": "Assignment description",
    "class_id": 1
  }
  ```

#### 2. GET `/classes/{class_id}/assignments/`
- **Purpose**: Get all assignments for a class

## Database Schema

### Assignment Model
```python
class Assignment(Base):
    __tablename__ = "assignments"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    class_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("classes.id"), index=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

### Pydantic Schemas
```python
class AssignmentUpdate(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None

class Assignment(AssignmentBase):
    id: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = None
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_assignment_endpoints.py`) is provided to verify all endpoints work correctly:

```bash
python test_assignment_endpoints.py
```

The test script covers:

- Class creation
- Assignment CRUD operations
- Permission validation
- Error handling
